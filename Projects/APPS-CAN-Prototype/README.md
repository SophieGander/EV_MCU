#APPS-CAN-Prototype

This prototype simulates a simple CAN bus, with 2 nodes, the main controller and a sensor.

The first node (STM1) is our main stm, the second node is another stm acting as a temporary CAN controller for the APPS.

Both stm's have CAN transceiver's hooked up to convert the CAN RX/TX to CAN HI/LOW.

Current state:
Unfinished, has some naming issues to resolve as well
