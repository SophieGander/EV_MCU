# APPS-CAN-Prototype
Owners: Matthew Van Brummelen \
Current State: Unfinished
### Description:

* This prototype simulates a simple CAN bus, with 2 nodes, the main controller and a sensor.

* The first node (STM1) is our main stm, the second node is another stm acting as a temporary CAN controller for the APPS.

* Both stms have CAN transceivers hooked up to convert the CAN RX/TX to CAN HI/LOW.
